# Lane Detection Model

This repository contains files related to a lane detection project developed for the **ASPC258 Applications of Engineering Design** class.

## Files

- **`carRunner.py`**: Python script for running the lane detection model with a car.
- **`Lane_Detection_Model.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and building the lane detection model.

## Project Overview

The project involves training a lane detection model using computer vision techniques. The model is designed to detect lane markings on roads using input from a car-mounted camera.

## Usage

### Running the Model

1. **Training the Model**: Refer to `Lane_Detection_Model.ipynb` for instructions on training the lane detection model.

2. **Using the Model**: Execute `carRunner.py` to run the trained model with a car. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed as specified in the notebook.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in `Lane_Detection_Model.ipynb`)

## Notes

- This project was completed as part of **ASPC258 Applications of Engineering Design**.
